# CLI

**This is the legacy Python-based CLI which no longer works with `webspaced`. See
[netsoc/cli](https://github.com/netsoc/cli) for the all-new integrated CLI.**

Python-based CLI which uses [`requests`](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) to talk to the
[backend](../webspaced/).

## Installation
Install Python 3 and `pip`, then run `sudo pip install .` - the `webspace` command will then be available in your
`$PATH`.
