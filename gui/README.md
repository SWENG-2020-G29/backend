# Frontend
This repository contains the frontend web GUI portion of `webspace-ng`, which talks to the backend in order to manage
a user's webspace.

## Developing
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) should be
installed.

Run `docker-compose up` to start the server - any changes to sources will automatically recompile and restart the
server.

You can then visit the app in your browser on http://localhost:8080.
